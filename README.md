##Testing Coverage 
To generate the code coverage, launch `npm test -- --coverage` which produces a file that contains a breakdown of
(Below image is result of coverage for the planarpuzzle code provided in  zip file)















# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What to do the first time
The first time you retrieve this code, you will need to install the react scripts to work properly. To do this, type:
`npm install react-scripts --save`
This is a one-time action for this project, which downloads and retrieves the necessary artifacts.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## Developer tips
Use ctrl+Shift+I – for developer tab – here you can see the page console logs and other erros,warnings.
